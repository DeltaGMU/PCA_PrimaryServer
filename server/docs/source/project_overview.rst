System Overview:
    This project consists of two software solutions.
    The first part is the employee timesheet system. With this timesheet system, employees
    are able to sign in to the employee login interface and submit their work hours for automatic payroll calculations.
    These calculations are available to the accountant who can download it as a neat report to input the pre-calculated payroll information into QuickBooks.

    are able to check-in/check-out the child from before-care and after-care with automatic invoice calculations.
    These calculations are available to the accountant who can download is as a neat report to input the pre-calculated invoice information into QuickBooks.
